# geralt_bot v1.1.1

Just a simple bot I made while learning how to develop discord bots.

The latest version of the bot can be found here: https://git.io/JEiRH. This repo will not be updated any further

## Features:
### Message listener

When added to a server, it listens in conversations for the following words, after which it will respond with the corresponding gif.
